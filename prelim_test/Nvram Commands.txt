1️⃣ Create a script file to handle the setup:

    sudo nano /usr/local/bin/setup_nvram.sh

2️⃣ Paste this into the script file:

    #!/bin/bash

    NVRAM_DIR="/home/master/Desktop/My Works/PROJECT/CODES/NVRAM"
    NVRAM_FILE="$NVRAM_DIR/nvram.img"

    mkdir -p "$NVRAM_DIR"
    touch "$NVRAM_FILE"
    chmod 600 "$NVRAM_FILE"
    truncate -s 2G "$NVRAM_FILE"

3️⃣ Make the script executable:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup_nvram.sh

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nvram-setup.service
